## Overview  

The repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of data structures and algorithms for competitive programming implemented in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and licensed under [MIT LICENSE](https://github.com/BinaryBeast007/Competitive-Programming/blob/main/LICENSE "LICENSE"). Source codes are compiled and tested for every commit on [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) & [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-20-04-lts-arrives).

## What is Competitive Programming?  
> Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers.  
> A programming competition generally involves the host presenting a set of logical or mathematical problems, also known as puzzles, to the contestants (who can vary in number from tens to several thousand), and contestants are required to write computer programs capable of solving each problem. Judging is based mostly upon several problems solved and time spent for writing successful solutions.
